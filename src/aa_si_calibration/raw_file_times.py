"""Last-ping-time extraction from Simrad EK60/EK80 raw files.

Reads datagram envelopes only, never sample payloads, so a file's true
recording end can be established without loading it. This settles the one case
the filename-time heuristic cannot decide: a file whose name stamp falls before
a requested window, where only the bytes say whether it records into it.

NOTE: mirrored from ``aa_si_utils.raw_file_times``, kept deliberately identical
so the two can be diffed. ``aa_si_calibration`` depends on neither
``aa_si_utils`` nor ``aa_recipe_manager`` (see ``_storage``), so this small
helper is duplicated rather than shared. The Simrad datagram envelope is a fixed
binary layout, so the copies are not expected to drift; keep them in sync if one
is changed.

``raw_reader_api`` covers the same ground far more thoroughly, but it pulls in
lxml and walks whole files. This module stays stdlib-only and cheap so the
storage layer can use it during path filtering, before any file is read.
